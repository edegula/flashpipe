# Setting Up OAuth Client for FlashPipe
This page describes the steps to set up an OAuth client for use with _FlashPipe_.

## Required Roles and Role-Templates
_FlashPipe_ relies heavily on access to Cloud Integration's public APIs. As such, it requires specific roles/role-templates in order to be able to access those APIs. Following are the tasks and corresponding role-templates that are required.

| Tasks                                                | Role-Templates (Cloud Foundry)     |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Create/edit design time artifacts                    | `WorkspacePackagesEdit`            |
| Configure artifacts                                  | `WorkspacePackagesConfigure`       |
| Deploy artifacts to runtime                          | `WorkspaceArtifactsDeploy`         |
| Monitor runtime artifacts                            | `MonitoringDataRead`               |
| Read content protected by Access Policies (Optional) | `AccessAllAccessPoliciesArtifacts` |

## (A) Creating an OAuth Client on Cloud Foundry
For Cloud Foundry, the default Process Integration Runtime service instance (with Plan = `api`) created using the guided Booster does not have sufficient permissions required for _FlashPipe_ to operate correctly. Therefore it is necessary to create an additional one following the steps listed below.

### 1. Logon to SAP BTP Cockpit
Access the relevant Cloud Foundry space on SAP BTP Cockpit.

### 2. Create new service instance
In the space, navigate to the `Services > Instances` and create a new instance.

### 3. Enter instance details
To access Cloud Integration APIs, we will enter the following details for the instance.
- Service:  `Process Integration Runtime`
- Plan: `api`
- Instance Name: `flashpipe-instance`

Click `Next`.

### 4. Enter required roles
Leave the default grant type to `client_credentials`. Select the roles shown below using the dropdown menu.

Click `Next`.

### 7. Create service key for instance
Once the instance has been create, click `***` its line and select `Create Service Key`.

### 8. Enter name of service key
Enter `flashpipe-key` as the name of the key.

### 9. View credentials of service key
Click on the created service key to view the credentials. Copy the following fields that will be needed for configuration with _FlashPipe_.
- `clientid`
- `clientsecret`
- `tokenurl`
